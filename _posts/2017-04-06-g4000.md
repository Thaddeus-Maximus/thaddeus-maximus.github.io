A buddy of mine got a [grizzly G4000](http://www.grizzly.com/products/9-x-19-Bench-Lathe/G4000) UIUC was throwing out and donated it to our [FRC Team](http://metalcowrobotics.com).

The tailstock is a lever-actuated system with a 3/8" hand drill chuck. It's a pretty simple setup that was easy to make; no tapers, no screws.

Calibration of centering is accomplished by simply moving the standoffs and retightening; somewhat of an eccentric tensioning steup.

The toolpost is a "Dee-post" inspired from [Paul Alciatore's Shop Made Toolpost](http://www.practicalmachinist.com/vb/south-bend-lathes/shop-made-qc-tool-post-200925/)

The motor is having some starting issues in higher loads. I'll make a separate post for that if they ever do get fixed... right now my EE buddy's hypothesis is the centrifugal switch isn't even turning on the start cap.
