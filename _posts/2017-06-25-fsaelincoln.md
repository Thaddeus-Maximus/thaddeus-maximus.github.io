Here's the lowdown:

Pre-lincoln: turbo is a no-go, swap a new naturally aspirated engine in. Have engine woes, the battery is shot, but eventually the jeezlus thing starts but it's running super lean. Remember that we were using a ported head. Install ported head, doesn't fix it. Fix the tune halfway, pack up, go to Linoln.

Tuesday: Drive to Lincoln. Install a new battery into 007 and forget we ever had battery issues.

Wednesday: Unpack, get to tech at a reasonable time. Tech is super slow. Fix a few things, and go home because tech is closed.

Thursday: Retech quickly. Tilt quickly. Sound once, pack muffler, resound quickly. Go to brakes.... don't lock up first time. Inflate tires, adjust bias, and redo brakes. Kill engine repeatedly. Fix fuel kink. Get fuel in car. Try to pass sound again. Break tensioner roller.

Freak out beceause you don't have another tensioner roller. Buy a skateboard wheel and make a new one. Be happy. But you still haven't passed sound.

Friday: Pass sound quickly. Break another tensioner roller. Install old crapped-out one so you can go to skidpad/accel. Make crappy acceleration run. Make crappy skidpad run because you forgot to fuel. Refuel. Go back to accel, lay down ok time. Go to skidpad, wait, and skidpad closes. Go to autocross in the afternoon. Lay down good autocross times.

Create aluminum tensioner roller for endurance. Install it and go home.

Saturday: Get car out with new roller and test it. Works fine for a bit. Continue. Engine stops laying down power at a certain point and makes nasty grinding sound. Chase the problem. Fail to find it. Go to endurance, lay down pretty mediocre times.

Still get 14th overall because scores were across the board pretty OK and design went well.

Ah well.
