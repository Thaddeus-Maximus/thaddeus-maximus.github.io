This is a satisfying little project. Milled from a single billet of mahogany with a maple pusher, this compact (5"x9") marble racetrack is delightful to listen to roll and clank.

.. ad infinatum :)

If you're interested in one, let me know! I'm thinking of making a batch of these soon, probably at around $600 apiece.

Features both a 5V barrel jack input and a 3xAA battery 'backup'. A small toggle switch on the back turns it on/off.
The pusher is powered by a miniature DC gearmotor running a scotch yoke.

The whole piece is finished with tung oil.
