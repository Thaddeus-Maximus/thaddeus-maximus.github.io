Rear unsprung mass connects the suspension and drivetrain to the wheel. It's pretty important that it be light for suspension response, stiff for suspension stability and tunability, and strong to, well, survive.

In all, this is the big change:

The upright looks totally different! There's a few contributing factors and other things not shown:
1. The bearings have changed from a 6813 to a JB025CP0 (provided I can get them). This drops about a quarter pound right here!
2. The overall structure does away with webs at the top and bottom to attach to brackets (with shimming potential).
3. The bottom bracket (which attaches to the pushrod A-arm) attaches to a strut directly above it- this provides a better load path.
4. The bearing boss is reduced in size and instead, more struts and stiffening ribs give support with less weight.

When evaluating stiffness of the whole system, I found that:

The stiffness is improved:
- By 59% for toe due to X loads (Important)
- By 75% for toe due to moments (Important)
- By 28% for camber due to Z loads (Important)

The stiffness is decreased:
- By 56% for camber due to normal force (Stiffness is high anyways)
- By 175% for camber due to moments (Stiffness very is high anyways)
- By 83% for camber due to X loads (Stiffness is high anyways)

The mass of the upright (just aluminum) actually remains the same (around 0.75lb)- I found that previous years' uprights were very slim on their fatigue life and we want to do more testing, so higher strength is desired.

Overall:
- Weight is reduced by ~0.25lb from bearing changes
- (endurance) Fatigue life is increased to a FOS of 1.5
- Stiffness in the important directions is increased by 28%-75%!

Excited to get these uprights manufactured and onto RGP007!
