Building on successes and learning from failures of 006's drivetrain, 007's proved to be a wonderful system with little issues. The major issues with 006 were:
- Failure of engine mount in rear on old car prompted buffing the tubes in this region
- Roller tensioner kept disintegrating
- Servicability of caliper was poor
- Jacking bar/truss was difficult to manufacture, and keep together.

To address these, respectively, I:
- Integrated the engine mount into the differential mount
- Opted to use a shim tensioning system rather than roller system
- Moved the caliper to the bottom of the car, revealing the bleeder valve to technicians
- Mounted the jacking bar/truss exclusively to the differential mount, rather than to the chassis as well (and shifted to simalarly sized sheetmetal throughout)

In addition to the usual FEA analysis to ensure everything was kosher.

This system faced only one issue: The shims for tensioning popped out. I foresaw this as a possibility, and made sure to design in 'ears' for safety wire to be installed such that the shim is retained even under severe vibration and compressive loads.
