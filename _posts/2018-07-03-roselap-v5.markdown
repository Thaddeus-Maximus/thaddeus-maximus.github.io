Building on the success of RoseLap v3 (and the short-lived v4), I built the core for RoseLap v5. [Check It Out!](https://github.com/RoseGPE/RoseLapWeb)

This is a lap-time simulation package; that is, it accepts simplified physical parameters of a car to simulate its performance around a racetrack. Combine this with a batcher and plotting tools, and it's a fantastic suite for determining what type of car to build for the FSAE Competition.

Features include:
 - Four grip-ellipse tire model
 - Aerodynamic modes (DRS, normal, airbrake)
 - Engine curve definition
 - Support for CVT transmissions
 - Lateral Load Transfer Distribution
 - Stable "SS" Solver for line-and-arc type tracks
 - Finite shift times
