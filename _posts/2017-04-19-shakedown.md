We're rolling... and not stopping quick enough.

Rear tires aren't locking up, and they need to in order to pass the brakes portion of technical inspection. Lots of air and a few leaks in the rear brake line, though, so when those get fixed, we might be good.

And, unfortunately, there's a rip in one of the drivetrain bags.

Other than that, looking good...
