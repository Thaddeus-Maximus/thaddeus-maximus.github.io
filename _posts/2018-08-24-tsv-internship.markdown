At Textron Specialized Vehicles, I worked on new product development within EZ-GO. Some of the major things I did were:
- Designing alternative mounts for seatback and basket supports (cost savings of $10+ per car)
- Finding ways to fit more RXV golf cars onto a trailer (potential cost savings of millions annually)
- Developing new procedures for adjusting brake pedals reliably on RXV golf cars
- Updating drawings for TXT front axles
