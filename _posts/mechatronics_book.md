This has been in the back of the oven for a while. Hopefully it isn’t too burnt.

A long time ago someone made the “encyclopedia robotica”. It was part of my introduction to the world of FRC, and I liked the idea.

It isn’t super comprehensive, though, is dated, and I prefer general-use materials that apply beyond our little robots. So… I do what I always do… roll my own. I also put it [in LaTeX on GitHub](https://github.com/Thaddeus-Maximus/mechatronics_book) 29 so that it can be kept up to date by readers like you as the kitbot becomes a differential swerve and the BAG suffers the same fate as The Bag. Any feedback or assistance is appreciated.

[Download the book](https://github.com/Thaddeus-Maximus/mechatronics_book/raw/master/mechatronics.pdf) or view it here:
