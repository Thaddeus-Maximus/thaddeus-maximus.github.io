I'm an engineer from a small farm in Illinois. I grew up fixing equipment and getting my hands dirty. I went through 4-H and learned a slew of skills there, and [started a bunch of robotics teams](/comprobotics). I earned a BSME with minors in various computer fields at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology, while bring highly active in [Formula SAE](/fsae).

I currently engineer for [DEKA R&D](https://www.dekaresearch.com) in New Hampshire, upkeep the [Manchester Makerspace](http://manchestermakerspace.org), and help FRC #501.

I like to keep lots of irons in many fires. I'm involved with many things:

 * Mechanical Design
 * Fabrication
 * Simulation/Analysis of physical phenomena
 * All the scaffolding organization, infrastructure, and management to make that happen

If you want to reach me, shoot an email to [hughes.thad@gmail.com](mailto:hughes.thad@gmail.com). I'll try get back pretty quick. I love to answer questions about what I've done, or how I can help you.
