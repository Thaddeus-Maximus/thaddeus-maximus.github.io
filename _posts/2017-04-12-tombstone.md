Sometimes, you need to hold something at an odd angle. Say you've got a hole on the side of an engine casing you need to make. How do you do that? Well, you could use a hand drill... but if you've a need for anything precise, you've gotta hold it sturdy. That's where a tombstone comes in. They're usually pretty pricey, and heavy as all else (for good reason, they ought to be stiff).

Sometimes, you've got the steel and time, but not the cash, and this is such a moment. No fancy ground surfaces, just a 2x4 0.25" wall thickness steel tube (it already had great surface finish) and a 5/8" steel plate. 1/2" holes, and spaced for typical 2.5" apart Bridgeport T-slots. The two main parts are welded together with some gussets to add some extra strength.

It's worked alright for minor features on some uprights! The timing on this project was pretty good, as there was literally no other way to do that machining.
