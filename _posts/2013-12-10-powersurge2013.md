Power Surge has had a very successful run this year! Division topscorers, and advancing onto state!

What contributed to our success?

Engineering principles. We follow 3S principles in mechanical design:

-  Simple: Make everything as simple as it needs to be, but not less.
-  Solid: Don't skimp out on bracing. Don't use the wrong type of bracing, either! This machine is able to withstand drops, juggling, whatever you throw at it.
-  Serviceable: Make sure you have access to everything. If you have to take apart anything just to deploy code or charge the battery, that's no good.
<br/><br/>

In addition to these, we also identified four other design imperatives:

-  Compact: Make things as small as possible. This robot is short in order to traverse underneath the zipline across the middle of the field.
-  Modular: Make places for lots of holes to go. Avoid putting in pins that do not add real structure. The robot should have holes, and attachments should go into the holes, and any pins on attachments should come off with themselves- no black pegs left over.
-  Controlled: Be able to have a lot of ways to maneuver. Line tracking, wall skidding, turning power, etc.
-  Speedy: Gear things up, do tasks in parallel; if you only have two and a half minutes to cover the field, every second counts.
-  Precise: Do things reliably; gear things down and space apart your wheels.
<br/><br/>

It's important to understand that these things are almost always tradeoffs: gearing up our drivetrain sacrificed our precision, but not by that much.

Technical Overview:

-  "Flat" drivetrain: using two NXT motors with a 20:16 gear ratio, we get speed, power, and precision in a small package. We have found the 2" pneumatic tires to provide us with maximum traction.

-  Bumpers around the entire drivetrain prevent lodging with the field. Casters on each corner allow us to run against and align with walls. "Mudflaps" on the back prevent a warped mat from getting swept up in the drivetrain (this was actually a last minute change at competition when the robot snagged on the mat, messing up the last leg of the run!)
-  A short arm with a plethora of mounting holes, driven by a NXT motor with a 12:40 ratio allows for many attachments. Attaching the arm directly to the 40 tooth gear greatly reduces backlash and wiggling while improving how much load can be carried.

-  MyBlock based programming. Almost never do we make direct calls to motors. MoveInches and TurnDegrees functions take care of drivetrain motions on the main thread, while SetArm, MoveArm, MoveArmBy, SetArmBy, and WaitForArm functions communicate with a separate thread which constantly regulates the arm position to take care of arm motions asynchrously. This allows us to move our arm to a position while doing several other things with our drivetrain, and not have to worry about losing positioning on the arm.
-  FLL in 2013 allowed for 4 motors, but the NXT hardware only allows 3 at a time. What to do with the 4th motor? Make a separate drivetrain for the endgame! You only need to get your NXT brick and some cargo over some humps in a straight line, so instead of making our entire robot get into the endzone, we rip off the brick and send it on its way.

Remember. Iterate, iterate, iterate! Everything went through revisions in order to perform at peak. The important thing is to not ask "does it work yet", but "is there room left to optimize?"!
