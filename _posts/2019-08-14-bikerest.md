Found old bike for $20 - bought it to use for buoyant bike project. Not a terrible bike. Then I had my main nice bike stolen. So I figured I'd make this one a really nice looking one and buy an even _worse_ bike for the buoyant bike project. Stripped everything down, powdercoated the frame, put it all back together. It's not the best thing, but it's a fun ride in the same way an FSAE car is fun - there's nothing to it and it's probably not very safe.
