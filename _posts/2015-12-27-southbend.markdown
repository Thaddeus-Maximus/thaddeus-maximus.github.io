My family's had an old South Bend lathe sitting around collecting dust for the longest time. After a half year of college and learning the ropes around such beautiful metalworking machines, I decided that the old thing needed to see the light of day again.

The general task was just to strip down, clean, rebuild most everything. These machines are quite beautiful works of art.
