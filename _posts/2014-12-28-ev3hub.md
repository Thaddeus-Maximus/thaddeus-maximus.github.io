When you're doing FLL, it's very very common to have to merge together programs. This leads of course to mayhem of losing work, overwriting code, etc. Something like github would be great, but EV3-G's save format is binary garbage that can't be really used in repository systems as it is.

So, I rolled my own!

![Overview of EV3Hub]({{ site.url }}/images/ev3hub_overview.png)

Features:

-  Files are segmented outand dynamically compiled; getting an old copy is as easy as clicking "GET".
-  Doesn't take as much storage space as hard backups since it's working off of changesets rather than hard backups.
-  Commits allow for multiple programmer names on one page, so you can keep track of who did what without kids having to deal with logging in and out.
-  Commits allow for only uploading what was changed, so as to not overwrite others' work.
-  Completely web based, written in python. No dependencies needed!
