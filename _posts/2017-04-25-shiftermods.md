Two potential issues with the electronic shifter became apparent:

The final gear reduction (If you call it that) is naked and exposed to the outside world! This means it's not that hard for dirt and rocks to get in and potentially jam up the gears, halting shifting. So, a mudguard is added. This is FSAE, not Baja, so nothing crazy. Testing up to this point says most residue is coming from the front (makes sense; vehicle is going forward).

The motor mount has been fortified with a back clamp. Previously, the motor is only held in the front by 2 M3 screws to the sheetmetal casing of the RS555, which I found liked to strip out frequently. Thus, add a clamp around the back to secure these motors, lest the loctite break loose from the vibrations. This actuator is mounted directly off the engine, after all...

Electrical claims to have fixed their issues. Seems to be working, but airport testing tomorrow will tell for sure!
