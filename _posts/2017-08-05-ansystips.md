The #1 biggest trick: the Hex-Dominant method. Any FEA analyst worth their salt knows that good elements are important, and that quads beat tris everyday. The typical approach may be to slice up a solid until it's in nice chunks ANSYS knows how to do with quads. This is time consuming and doesn't always work.

Fortunately, there's a meshing method that almost always works to make excellent quad meshes: the Hex-Dominant mesher. It doesn't always work, especially with the all-quads option, but if you've got something with lots of struts (which I frequently do), then this mesher is an excellent way to quickly make a mesh that will converge faster with less elements. The mesher does take significantly longer to run (it may have to do multiple passes and attempts to resolve the tris into quads) but if you're doing nonlinear analysis or batch runs, the payoff is well worth the computational time.
