It's been a long time coming, but the electronic shift actuator has been implemented on the car with decent success!

As seen in the video, some cams on the shaft used for sensing position are not secured... so shifting goes slower as the motor just jams the actuator for a timeout time. With the engine off, we were getting consistent, rapid shifting.

Apparently, though, these switches don't like the vibration of the car and intermettently contact. This needs to be investigated further; I wasn't actually present for this run. Good to see that I can make something other engineers can take over for me!
