In Formula SAE, we use chain drives all the time, since motorcycle and ATV engines, whose suspensions lend themselves to the drive system, are set up for chain. I wanted to understand how chain wrap is important- why can the main sprocket be aluminum, yet links must be steel? Plus, I needed a final project for ME422 (Finite Element Fundamentals). So, I analyzed and pocketed a typical sprocket.
