I'm making cutting/charcuterie boards for sale locally. I'm just getting into this. Quantities limited and offerrings are changing. We'll see how much demand for this there is - it's something I enjoy doing!

Email me at hughes.thad@gmail.com for inquiries - or if you're getting this through the DEKA postings hunt me down or shoot me an email. I'll keep samples at my desk.

All boards are solid wood. No veneer. No particleboard. No shortcuts.

All boards have been soaked in mineral oil and waxed to keep it in. Food grade and reliable.
