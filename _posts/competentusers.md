A lot of engineering designs revolve around not allowing the user to "do dumb things". Honestly, this is a great thing to do. There are many cases, especially in protective equipment that is a matter of life and death, where the potential for harm is far, far too high.

However, legalism and holding human life as the highest good rather than something divine will always drag human life down, rather than lifting it up. We need danger. We need to be able to let our users have the chance to be competent.
