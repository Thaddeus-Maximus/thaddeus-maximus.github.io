Toolboxes are never right. But they can be better. I figured I might as well give a decent go at making some toolboxes for the back of my car. I follow the Adam Savage mentality that drawers are generally evil- I want access to my tools with as little inhibition as possible!

Made from baltic birch, with some aluminum reinforcing framing on the edges to prevent splintering.
