Laptime simulation gives us lots of neat data. But what matters is learning things from the data- what engine to use, what aero tradeoffs exist, how engine power affects aerodynamic tradeoffs, and the like.

There's just too much for a blog post, so read the full report here: [RoseLap Report](/hosted/RoseLap - Summer Report.pdf)
