I really liked the wooden hinge boxes that [Pask Makes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P77Mtc6kkXk). So I made one at first for myself, and then a better one for my mom's Christmas gift.

This is solid Walnut, with a brass clasp and felt bottom. The whole piece is finished with tung oil, then paste wax to bring out some shine.
