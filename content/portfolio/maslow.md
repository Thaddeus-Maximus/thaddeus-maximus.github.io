We needed more space in [our shop](https://www.manchestermakerspace.org), so I made a way for our Maslow CNC router to open and close to add extra room in the shop.

This was accomplished by a custom metal top frame and some gas shocks properly placed at the bottom.

## Chains

Along the way I added some guards to keep chains from jumping off the sprockets, a pretty notorious problem with this style of CNC.

## Extra Room

This gives us some precious maneuvering room back. We'll add dust collection next...
