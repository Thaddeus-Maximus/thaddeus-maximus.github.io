#      Setting grain augers is not fun. They are one-ton, maybe two-ton clunky pieces of equipment they you're supposed to move by hand. Lots of companies have started to make movers, but I figured I'd make my own, using two 1.5HP tarp motors.

#      I began with a CAD for the drive. This features a 10-tooth, #50 chain sprocket that engages with a custom-made 55T ring gear. The whole motor-and-sprocket is on a pivot, so that it can be disengaged while towing the auger.
#
#      I laser cut a prototype out of plywood to verify that things would line up the way I thought they would. No problems, so onto the actual building! I had the parts made by SendCutSend.

#      Fabricating the ring gear was the most fun and interesting part. I purchased a ring roller for this project and made the rings myself. The rings would secure to the rim of the tires with 6x 3/8-16 UNC set screws.

 #     But will it work?

#      Looks like it might... well, might as well get everything painted, and wired properly! I used a little remote-controlled [relay box](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CCVJWL9) wired up to some tarp relays.

#      Overall, it's a decent help. It isn't perfect. We still needed to push the auger the final few feet into bin sites (on account of the well touching the ground providing a lot of resistance), but jogging the auger around is such a breeze.
