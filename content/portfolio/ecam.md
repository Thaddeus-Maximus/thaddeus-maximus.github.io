A client needed to simulate a camshaft, but change the profile on the fly. I produced a machine that simulated the cam profile with individual high-speed effectors with sub-millimeter accuracy even at high speeds. 

This was a fun project that used the ecamming feature of a digital motor controller. Even though these are short distances, the high speeds - and accelerations - proved demanding at the required resolution.
