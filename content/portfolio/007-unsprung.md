Optimized unsprung mass for a Formula-style racecar.

Unsprung mass is that which conncects the suspension of a car to the tires- the uprights, hubs, wheel centers, rims, and any supporting parts. The system objective is simple: minimize mass, maximize stiffness, balance lifetime.

This year's design focused on load paths better- which resulted in higher strength and stiffness on the rear, and higher strength and stiffness on the front with 0.25 lb less mass per corner.
