      A set of online free-to-use engineering analysis tools - lightweight and suckless.

      This started because of the countless JVN calc clones - I wanted one that did sprint speeds for FRC bots. But then I realized I could do a lot more.

      - General Mechanism Simulator

      - Wheeled Pitchers

      - Ballistic Trajectory

      - Timing belt sizing

      - Beam tool (which is actually a beam FEA tool. It's very flexible. I'm most proud of this one).

      - Transmission strength calculator for FRC

      - O ring calculator

      - ISO fit calculator

      - 1D cut optimizer

      - And More...

      And all of this designed with the intents to:
      - Be self-contained; each calculator can export itself to a self-contained, 'living' .html file for future reference.
      - Be suckless; no dependence on external libraries; all vanilla JS and lightweight
      - Allow for multiple units and ease of use; better than an excel spreadsheet.
