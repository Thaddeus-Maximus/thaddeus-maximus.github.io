A set of online free-to-use engineering analysis tools. Lightweight and suckless.

<!--more-->

This started because of the countless JVN calc clones - I wanted one that did sprint speeds for FRC bots. But then I realized I could do a lot more.

- General Mechanism Simulator
- Wheeled Pitchers
- Ballistic Trajectory
- Timing belt sizing
- Beam tool (which is actually a beam FEA tool. It's very flexible. I'm most proud of this one).
- Transmission strength calculator for FRC
- O ring calculator
- ISO fit calculator (actually the most useful of all of these)
- 1D cut optimizer
- More

And all of this designed with the intents to:
- Be self-contained; each calculator can export itself to a self-contained, 'living' .html file for future reference.
- Be suckless; no dependence on external libraries; all vanilla JS and lightweight
- Allow for multiple units and ease of use; better than an excel spreadsheet.
