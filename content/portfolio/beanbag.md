People have made drivable chairs. And couches. Even hammocks! We needed to do something really original. What about... a drivable beanbag?

**Yes. Now _this_ is style.**

## Electronics

The electronics are some 1kW brushless (sensored) motors usually used for electric skateboards. Cheap ones though. These are driven by a Flipsky ESC, which is fed PWM signal from a little arduino Nano, which recieves joystick data from a wireless PS2 controller. All the power comes from three 12V lead-acid batteries (the size used in FRC) in series for a 36V system.

It took a while to get the motors configured and working with vesc. When I got the ESCs working, it was a big relief.

## Drivetrain

We started out with a 4WD concept. That seemed like a great idea... until we started trying to turn. So, going to 6WD could have been better, but I was going to bring this to the 24 hours of lemons as a pit vehicle. I needed something to work ASAP.

The great thing about a Makerspace is the solution is on hand. We removed the front wheels and replaced them with a set of plain swivel casters. Perfect. We're turning now!

And *drifting* even!

Now these were cheapo casters. I knew they would probably fail on me, so I brought replacements to the Lemons race. And oh yes they failed - but no sooner than they needed to. They lasted long enough to drive around the grounds.

But when we got back, something had to change. I designed some really heavy-duty casters with tapered needle roller bearings and some super sweet pneumatic wheels. These have been working much better with little problem.

But the rear tires were still a problem. They were just cheapo tires from harbor freight. Not even rubber really, just a gummy plastic.

Good thing at the time I worked at a place that made wheelchairs. I got some more durable, larger wheels we weren't using any more and put those on instead.
