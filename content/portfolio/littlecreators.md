Sacred art that I draw and sell.

<!--more-->

I was particularly drawn to the style of Ade Bethune, and being a member of a Byzantine Catholic parish, I really love the traditional images there - so this is a fusion of those styles, hoping to speak to modern sensibilities with a sense of symbolism and the sacred. I hope you enjoy my work.
