RGP-006 was a prototype racecar I helped enter into the 2016 Formula SAE season while a student at Rose-Hulman. Our previous entry, RGP-005 was quite successful, but suffered issues with its drivetrain.

We determined that engine braking put much higher stresses on the drivetrain than expected, leading 005 to chew through tensioner rollers and other like components.

And, of course, we wanted to make other improvements too.

## Braking

The most obvious change was to move from outboard braking (brake rotors on the wheels) to inboard braking (a singular brake disc on the differential). This reduces unsprung, rotational, and overall system mass, leading to better driving.

## Tensioning

Since 006 uses the same YFZ-450R motorbike engine as its predecessor, a chain drive was determined to be the best way to transfer power from the engine to the axle. Chain drives need tensioning, and 006 uses an idler roller style setup just like RGP005, but rather than being an actuated lever, which leads to stress concentrations around bolt contact points, I employed a slot system. This meant better distributed loads and a greater range of tensioning positions. RGP005 physically could not use a 34T sprocket (without use of half-links), but RGP006 can use 28, 30, 32, 34, and 36 tooth sprockets, allowing a range of final drive ratios that can be changed based on driver experience.

Swapping from a 13T to a 14T front sprocket increases vehicle acceleration. At FSAE Lincoln last year, drivers noted inability to even begin using fifth gear on the car. Using a taller ratio will allow better utilization of gears.

## Axle plunging system, and tripod geometry

We've traditionally used [Taylor Race Engineering Axles](http://www.taylor-race.com/items.cfm?category=Drive%20Axle%20Components&subcategory1=Axles&subcategory2=Tripod). Last year faced issues with tripods popping out on the right side due to too short of axles; this has been fixed and doubly fixed with properly cut snap ring grooves. Previously, we've ground in the grooves to the hardened 4340 steel. This year, I ground my own carbide snap ring groover and used that, which produced much better grooves.

Axle angle is amazingly shallow this year- between 1 and 7 degrees along the entire suspension travel, which minimized movement and maximized efficiency.

## Jacking truss

The differential mount, being the rearmost component of the car and centered, has been prime position for the jacking bar to go on. Historically, it's been a simply supported bar between two struts on the main diff mounts.

Another interesting problem is the need to stiffen up the two mounts relative to each other.

Why not solve both of these problems at once? As such, the jacking truss is born.

## Results

RGP006 successfully completed all events with no drivetrain issues, placing **14th** out of 80 teams at Lincoln and *30th* out of 120 teams at Michigan.

We did suffer some wear on the tensioner roller, though - and so we set out to change things with [RGP007](/portfolio/007-dt).
