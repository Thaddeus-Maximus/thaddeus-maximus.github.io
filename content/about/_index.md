## Story

Growing up around tractors and combines on a farm in Illinois, it didn't take long to realize that I had [The Knack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8vHhgh6oM0). And it didn't help that my favorite activity while on a ride-along with mom in the combine was to read the owner's manual - so many cool pictures of gears and sprockets.

In 2012 I helped start [FRC Team #4213](http://metalcowrobotics.com/). I spent most of my time doing the software - because it needed to be done. I started getting more room to flex my mechanical muscles as time went on, though. I mentored FLL teams and brought good success to the many teams I fostered in my area. The kid in the blue below actually followed me (green) to RHIT. The kid in the grey followed me onto FRC #4213 and almost won the world championship in 2022.

In 2015 I went off to college to study mechanical engineering, and I built racecars. I learned how to machine (and it became a passion of mine) - way better than just hobbled together fabrication. I also studied computer science, computational science, electrical engineering...

In 2019 I moved to New Hampshire to work for [DEKA R&D](http://www.dekaresearch.com/) as a Mechanical Design Engineer. I built many things in my tenure there which they don't let me talk about too much. The high points were blowing up an IV bag to the size of a beach ball, and poking a million dollar machine I built with a crowbar so that it would work - which led to a successful demo, happy client, and continued funding for a project.

In 2022 me and some friends started a [podcast](https://www.machinaeexdeo.com) where we talk about how technology is related the the spiritual realm and things divine. We love the word 'numinosity'. In 2023 I started an [iconography business with a pretty unique style](https://littlecreators.shop).
