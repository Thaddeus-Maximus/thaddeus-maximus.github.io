I'm Thad. I'm an engineer and much more, with an ag background. I design and build things that are owner-operator-minded, or at least suck less than complicated junk most engineers come up with.

I'm interdisciplinary and hands-on: design, build, test, ship.

Got a big project? Or just a broken trailer that needs fixed? Contact:
[thad@thadhughes.xyz](mailto:thad@thadhughes.xyz) or [309-530-0909](tel:3095300909).
