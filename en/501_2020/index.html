        <p>I can&rsquo;t be kept from FRC, I guess. I helped FRC 501 for their pretty successful 2020 season. The game&rsquo;s objective was to shoot dodgeballs and do a pull-up at the end of the game. We looked at the field and saw a pretty cool strategy that could be successful: shoot across the entire field, minimizing the distance to the feeder station, which was a very good supply of balls, and the full-court position was protected, making shooting from there easier.</p>

<p>We took the robot to the week 0 event without too many hopes, just wanting to shake the thing down. At first it looked like that was about how it would happen. We weren&rsquo;t looking too hot in the first few matches, but we kept improving, and carried our alliance into finals, and to take the whole event, which was a very happy occasion.</p>

<p>We decided after that to name the bot the &lsquo;full court zester&rsquo; since it shoots full court and the yellow dodgeballs leave a &lsquo;zest&rsquo; as they pass through the flywheel shooter.</p>

<p>I was new to a lot of folks but still managed to teach a lot about using CAD properly and powerfully, strategizing, goal-setting, general mechanical work, and principles of mechanical engineering.</p>
