# Some of my favorite reads/listens, which have influenced my work, or embodied its spirit the most:

The [Essential Craftsman Podcast](https://essentialcraftsman.com/podcast) exemplifies the nature of why we do things; the wise words of a skilled worker with a passion for learning and an unbreakable spirit.

I'm working on a text summarizing the mechanics portion of my ConApps course at RHIT, which really changed / set in stone my engineering analysis mindset.

Milliken and Milliken's [Racecar Vehicle Dynamics (RCVD)](https://www.sae.org/publications/books/content/r-146/) is a quintessential read for those interested in, well, vehicle dynamics, as well as dynamics in general.

C.S. Lewis' [The Abolition of Man](https://www.cslewis.com/the-abolition-of-man/) has proven to be without a doubt, one of the most important works for the 21st century, for laymen, evangelists, and engineers alike.

Henry Petroski's [To Engineer is Human](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0679734163) is a delightful read that I came across by accident while staying at an AirBnB in South Dakota.

Eugene Vodolazkin's [Laurus](https://www.amazon.com/dp/178074871X) is the essential, and opposite side of the coin from The Abolition of Man.

A strange but delightful read I came across was [Ancient and Postmodern Christianity: Paleo-Orthodoxy in the 21st Century (Essays in Honor of Thomas C. Oden)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0830826548)
