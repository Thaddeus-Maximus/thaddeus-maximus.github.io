“Play”
Thad

PLAY!
Bear fruit. Do More.
Open your heart.
Play again.
“Like a child”
PLAY.

Play is not consumption
    Is not titillation
It is the continuation of God’s Project.
PLAY.

Play is not anarchy
    Is not order
Play is play
    Is development
        Is seizing of opportunity
        GRANTED BY GOD!
WHAT CAN BE HIGHER?

The highest gift we have been given
    The marriage of divine law and free will
        The chance to share in the divine comedy
A PLAY!

For in it we find our values
    Reciprocating
        Sportsmanship
            Goodwill
An ebb and flow, a give and take

PLAY!
