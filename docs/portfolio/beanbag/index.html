            The electronics are some 1kW brushless (sensored) motors usually used for electric skateboards. Cheap ones though. These are driven by a Flipsky ESC, which is fed PWM signal from a little arduino Nano, which recieves joystick data from a wireless PS2 controller. All the power comes from three 12V lead-acid batteries (the size used in FRC) in series for a 36V system.
It took a while to get the motors configured and working with vesc. When I got the ESCs working, it was a big relief.

            We started out with a 4WD concept. That seemed like a great idea&hellip; until we started trying to turn. So, going to 6WD could have been better, but I was going to bring this to the 24 hours of lemons as a pit vehicle. I needed something to work ASAP. We removed the front wheels and replaced them with a set of plain swivel casters. Perfect. We&rsquo;re turning now!

            Now these were cheapo casters. I knew they would probably fail on me, so I brought replacements to the Lemons race. And oh yes they failed - but no sooner than they needed to. They lasted long enough to drive around the grounds.
But when we got back, something had to change. I designed some really heavy-duty casters with tapered needle roller bearings and some super sweet pneumatic wheels. These have been working much better with little problem.
But the rear tires were still a problem. They were just cheapo tires from harbor freight. Not even rubber really, just a gummy plastic.
Good thing at the time I worked at a place that made wheelchairs. I got some more durable, larger wheels we weren&rsquo;t using any more and put those on instead.
