            <p>Past members on the RoseGPE team tried to develop paddle shifting for thair cars, with mostly poor success. Pneumatics are heavy. Linear actuators are lossy. The system needed to be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Efficient in terms of power; electrical power is sparse</li>
<li>Fast; more speed = more better</li>
<li>Fully robust; if it mis-shifts, it can&rsquo;t get stuck
With this in mind, I wanted to develop something that was dead-nuts simple mechanically with high efficiency. A few concepts were considered:</li>
<li>4-bar linkage from a planetary gearbox</li>
<li>Full spur gearbox</li>
<li>Worm gearbox</li>
<li>Sector gear driven by planetary gearbox
Of these, the 4-bar and sector gears offered the highest efficiency and ease of manufacture. The sector gear option would require, of course, a custom sector gear- a costly EDM operation. However, this option offers the smoothest power delivery at high travels.</li>
</ul>

            <p>With this in mind, I began designing and made a prototype. This made a few things quite apparent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mounting to the YFZ450R around the shift shaft region is HARD. There are few bolts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mesh is important!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The engine CAD we had was horribly wrong. None of the bolts were in the places the CAD said they were.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if a component is a simple prototype part, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to analyze it- the load paths could be so bad that the part is useless.</p>
</li>
</ul>

            <div class="caption"></div>
            After dealing with these problems, I built a second revision that addressed these issues. The shifter mounts to the case bolts and chain guard - three good rigid mounting points. The sector gear was analyzed and supports for it drawn out further to better take the torque from the spur gear.

            <div class="caption"></div>
            In the video, you can see some cams rattling on the shaft next to some micro switches. After some experimenting, we determined that we really didn&rsquo;t need the complexity of sensing the shaft position - simply running the actuator for set amounts of time worked to make successful shifts!
