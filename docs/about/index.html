            I grew up on a farm in Shirley, IL - where I learned how to drive, weld, fabricate, wire, program, and more. I transitioned into becoming a mechanical engineer before moving out to New Hampshire and furthering my on-the-job know-how. In the past decade I&rsquo;ve built competition-winning robots, IV production equipment, retrofitted RVs, motorized beanbags, church furniture, and more.

            I am deeply interested in the <em>quality</em> of technology in the world. My friends and I explore this in our <a href="https://www.machinaeexdeo.com">blog + podcast</a>. We need new (or rather, so-old-they&rsquo;re-new) ways of thinking about technology, or we will continue to build with the same philosophies that produce big technocratic tyrranies. There are a lot of engineers out there who will tell you how complex of systems they have worked on. I pride myself on how <a href="https://suckless.org/">suckless</a> my solutions are.

            Growing up fixing and maintaining equipment, I have a deep appreciation for the whole lifecycle of a machine: design, fabrication, maintenance, operation, repair, obsolesence, and repurposing. I strive to produce things that truly add value to their owners (and their communities) for generations through good engineering and craftsmanship. Technology can and should be a means to enhance and perfect human work and life at large - not to do away with the pesky business of life.

            I helped start <a href="http://metalcowrobotics.com/">FIRST Robotics Competition Team #4213</a>, built up a lot of FLL teams in the Bloomington, IL area, drastically helped improve <a href="http://manchestermakerspace.org">Manchester Makerspace</a>, and more.
