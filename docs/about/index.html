    <h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I grew up on a farm in Shirley, IL where I first learned how to drive, weld, fabricate, wire, program, and more. I went to Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology where I studied mechanical engineering and built Formula-style racecars. Upon graduation, I worked at DEKA Research and Development, developing IV production machines, manufacturing equipment, delivery robots, new medical devices, and even retrofitting an RV. Desiring to be closer to family, community, and roots, I moved back to the farm, but am continuing to serve those around me with the gifts God has given me.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy</h2>
<p>&ldquo;A jack of all trades is a master of none, but oftentimes better than a master of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I bring a holistic / interdisciplinary / &lsquo;big picture&rsquo; view to my work. Someone more specialized and siloed might struggle when they reach a part of a project that is outside their wheelhouse - but I design and work on complicated systems with relative ease. Raised as a farmer and repairman, I end up building things that <a href="http://suckless.org/philosophy/">suck less</a> than what a lot of other designers come up with.</p>
<p>I am a staunch proponent of <strong>open-source</strong> software and hardware, and the <strong>right to repair</strong>.</p>
