# HEY, IF YOU FORGOT HOW THIS WORKS...

 - `cd` to this directory
 - run `hugo` to publish to the `docs` folder
 - `git add docs` (and other things)
 - commit and push to GitHub (set up to publish Github pages from the /docs folder)

 You don't need to add the /resources folder

 You run `hugo serve` to get a live working version on your machine
