# Some info 
I'm a 19 year old aspiring engineer. I currently study Mechanical Engineering at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](http://rose-hulman.edu), and am the lead of our Formula SAE Team, RoseGPE. I have a bunch of other cool honors and stuff, apparently, but I think that's the most important one, to me.

I love to do anything with structural and dynamic engineering, control systems, programming, and computational science.
